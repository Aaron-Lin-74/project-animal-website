        <h2>LEGAL NOTICE, TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <h2>(ENGLISH)</h2>
        <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
        <p>
          While the contents of our pages have been created with utmost care and
          due diligence, we cannot assume liability for the completeness and
          timeliness of the contents. In accordance with general law, as service
          provider we are responsible for our own content on this web page.
          However, we as service provider, are neither obliged to monitor
          transmitted or stored external information, nor to research
          circumstances that suggest an illegal activity. Obligations to remove
          or block the use of information remain, in accordance with legal
          regulations, unaffected. Any liability in this respect can be assumed
          only from the moment that knowledge of the specific breach of law is
          obtained. In the event that the corresponding violations become known,
          we shall remove these contents immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
        <p>
          Our website contains links to external websites operated by third
          parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot
          assume liability for these contents. Instead, it is the relevant
          supplier or operator of the linked web pages who is responsible for
          the content of these pages. The linked pages were inspected for
          possible legal infringements at the time the link was established. At
          the time of linking, no unlawful contents were detectable. Permanent
          monitoring of the content of the linked pages is infeasible without
          any specific indication of an infringement of rights. In the event
          that corresponding violations become known, we shall remove the
          corresponding links immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Copyright</h3>
        <p>
          The contents and works on these websites, as prepared and displayed by
          its operator, are subject to copyright law. Their duplication,
          processing, distribution, or any form of commercialization beyond the
          scope of the copyright law requires the written consent of the
          respective author or creator. Copies and downloads are allowed solely
          for private and non-commercial purposes. Insofar as this page's
          contents were not created by its operator, third-party copyrights will
          be respected and observed. Should you still have reason to believe
          that a copyright violation has occurred despite the precautionary
          measures taken, we kindly ask you to notify us. In the event that the
          corresponding violations become known, we shall remove this content
          immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Data and Privacy Protection/Data Privacy</h3>

          We would like to point out that the transfer of data via the internet
